This is intended to give an example of how to run this library.

1. Take the original dump files in the dump_files directory and convert them to TSV with:
`bash 01_convert_dump_files.sh`

2. Then, convert TSV files to statistics doing something like:
`python3 02_wiki_stats.py -i tsv_files/sailormoon.tsv -o output_files`

You can then cat these files togeter at the end to have one big stats file.
