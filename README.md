MediaWiki-Networks
==================
This is a bunch of code that I've been using to collect data from the XML dump of edit history for users of the WeRelate website.

For now, I'm mostly using this as a way to sync code between a few different computers. It's a giant mess, and you will almost certainly need to do a lot of work to get it ready to run on your data.

My goal is to find the time to put it together nicely so that it's reusable for others who want to create networks from MediaWiki edit histories.
